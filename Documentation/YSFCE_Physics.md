# YSFlight Atmospheric Model

The YSFlight atmospheric model is based on the 1976 U.S. Standard Atmosphere model from https://www.digitaldutch.com/atmoscalc/table.htm. The table below shows the various properties of the YSFCE atmosphere. For all parameters at intermediate altitudes, one-dimensional linear interpolation is used with altitudes beyond the table using the closest altitude's values.

| Altitude (m) | Density (kg/m3)    | Temperature (K) | Pressure (Pa) | Speed of sound (m/s) | Viscosity (Pa/s)  |

# Jet Engine Performance

Jet engine performance is a function of DAT variables and altitude. 

<br>

## Jet Engine Thrust

The thrust of the jet engine is calculated based on the DAT file, throttle setting and altitude (in the form of the jet engine thrust efficiency). This equation does not account for thrust reversers or thrust vectoring.

For non-afterburning operations:

$$T = \eta   \times   Thr   \times   THRMILIT$$

For afterburning operations: 

$$T = \eta   \times   THRMILIT   \times   (THRAFTBN   -   THRMILIT)   \times   Thr$$

Where:
- $\eta$ is the Jet Engine Thrust Efficiency
- $Thr$ is the throttle
<br>

## Jet Engine Thrust Efficiency

The Jet Engine Thrust Effiency $\eta$ is a function of altitude. For all altitudes between 0 and 32000m, $\eta$ is a one-dimensional linear interpolation of the table. For all values outside the table, the value of the closest is used.

| Altitude (m) | $\eta$ |
| ------------ | ------ | 
| -2000 | 1 | 
|4000 | 1|
| 12000 | 0.6 | 
| 16000 | 0.3 | 
| 20000 | 0.084991 | 
| 31999 | 0.084991 | 
| 32000 | 0 | 


## Jet Engine Fuel Consumption

The DAT file defines the sea-level fuel consumption at maximum afterburning and non-afterburning throttle settings. 
<br>

### YSFlight Fuel Consumption

For Afterburning operations:

$$\dot{F} = dt   \times   FUELABRN$$

For non-Afterburning operations:

$$\dot{F} = dt   \times   FUELMILI   \times   Thr$$

Where:
- $\dot{F}$ is the change in fuel weight
- $dt$ is the change in time
- $Thr$ is the throttle setting

<br>

### Future YSFCE Fuel Consumption

This future scheme allows for a closer approximation of Thrust Specific Fuel Consumption.

For Afterburning Operations:

$$\dot{F} = dt   \times   FUELABRN   \times   \left( \frac{T}{THRAFTBN} \right)$$

For Non-Afterburning Operations:

$$\dot{F} = dt   \times   FUELMILI   \times   Thr \times   \left( \frac{T}{THRAFTBN} \right)$$

Where:
- $\dot{F}$ is the change in fuel weight
- $dt$ is the change in time
- $Thr$ is the throttle setting
- $T$ is the thrust being generated by the engine


<br>

# Simple Propeller Engine Performance

The propeller thrust calculation involves air speed for slow and high-speed calculations. Propeller engines use the following DAT files.

<br>

## Slow Speed Thrust

When airspeed is below the PROPVMIN DAT variable setting there is a different equation for calculating how much thrust the engine produces.

$$P = PROPELLR   \times   Thr   \times   \frac{PROPEFCY}{PROPVMIN}$$ 

<br>

$$T = \frac{\rho_{sea}}{\rho_{alt}}   \times   \frac{P}{V}$$

where:
- $P$ = Power
- $T$ = Thrust
- $\rho_{sea}$ = Air Density at sea level (kg/m3)
- $\rho_{alt}$ = Air Density at aircraft's altitude (kg/m3)
- $V$ = Aircraft Velocity (m/s)
- $Thr$ = Throttle setting

<br>

## High Speed Thrust

When airspeed is equal to or above the PROPVMIN DAT variable setting the following thrust equations apply:

Upon loading the aircraft the following property is calculated:

$$PropK = - \left(\frac{PROPELLR   \times   PROPEFCY}{PROPVMIN^2}\right)$$

Which is used in calcualting the thrust of the aircraft

$$T_{Static} = PROPELLR   \times   \frac{PROPEFCY}{PROPVMIN}$$

<br>

$$T_{Moving} = T_{Static} - PropK \times \left(PROPVMIN  \times  V \right)$$ 

Where:
- $T_{Static}$ Static thrust of propeller engine
- $T_{Moving}$ Thrust of propeller engine when aircraft flying faster than PROPVMIN.
- $V$ = Aircraft Velocity (m/s)
- $PropK$ = Unknown constant, probably a flux with J/s [^1]

[^1]: Need to understand what this means in real world

<br>







# Real Propeller Thrust

In 2015 YSFlight, Soji introduced the real propeller engine model which also unlocked the ability to have multiple propeller engines.

## Blades
Each engine defines performance for a single blade, and then multiplies that by the number of propellers in the engine.









<br>

# Mach Number

The mach number of the aircraft is calculated by first determining the speed of sound at the aircraft's altitude and then dividing the aircraft's speed by that value:

$$Mach   =   \frac{V}{a}$$

Where:
- $V$ is the aircraft's speed
- $a$ is the speed of sound.

<br>

# Gravity

Gravity is treated as a constant throughout the YSFCE atmosphere:

$$g = 9.807$$

<br>

# Lift & Drag Coefficient Calculation

The relevant constants for calculating the Lift and Drag Coefficients at different angles of attack are calculated when the DAT File goes through the auto-calculate (AutoCalculate() method) process. The specific lift coefficient and drag coefficient for each angle of attack for each aircraft are performed with those constants in the GetLift() and GetDrag() methods at each simulation update.

## Lift Coeficient Calculation
$$C_{L_0} = \frac{g \times \left(WEIGHCLN + WEIGFUEL\right)}{0.5 \times \rho_{REFACRUS} \times REFVCRUS^2 \times WINGAREA}$$

<br>

$$C_{L_{Land}} = \left(\frac{ g  \times  \left(WEIGHCLN + WEIGFUEL \right)}{0.5 \times  \rho_{Sea} \times REFVLAND^2 \times WINGAREA} \right)   \left(\frac{1}{ 1.0 + CLBYFLAP }\right)   \left(\frac{1}{ 1.0 + CLVARGEO }\right)$$

<br>

$$C_{L_{Slope}} = \frac{C_{L_{Land}} - C_{L_0}}{REFAOALD}$$

where:

- $\rho_{REFACRUS}$ = Air Density at cruise altitude
- $g$ = Gravitational Acceleration
- $\rho_{Sea}$ = Air density at sea level
- $C_{L_0}$ = Lift coefficient at zero angle of attack.
- $C_{L_{Land}}$ = Lift coefficient at landing approach angle of attack

<br>

### Lift Coefficient For Helicopters

Note: For helicopters, $C_{L_0}$ and $C_{L_{Slope}}$ are zero.

<br>

### Lift Coefficient Regions

There are several regions to the Lift Coefficient curve, delimited by angle of attack ranges which are defined by variables in the DAT File:

![Lift regions](CL_CD_Curves.jpg)

- Negative AoA Decay range (negative stall range) (CLDECAY2)
- Negative AoA Flat range (FLATCLR2)
- Normal flight envelope, with AoA above the minimum critical AoA and below the positive critical AoA (CRITAOAM and CRITAOAP)
- Positive AoA Flat region (FLATCLR1)
- Positive AoA Decay (positive stall range) (CLDECAY1)

In YSFlight's default content, only the [F-22](../runtime/aircraft/f22.dat) specifies FLATCLR1, FLATCLR2, CLDECAY1, and CLDECAY2. For all of the other aircraft these variables are ommitted and the AutoCalculate() method sets all of them to zero, causing the $C_L$ calculation to default to the catchall 'else' in the code for the 'GetLift()' method which simply sets $C_L = 0.0$ for all AoAs above CRITAOAP or below CRITAOM.

For all default aircraft except for the F-22:

When $\alpha$ is between CRITAOAM and CRITAOAP (normal flight envelope):  
($CRITAOAM \le \alpha \le CRITAOAP$)

$$C_L = \left(C_{L_{0}} + \alpha \times C_{L_{slope}}  \right) \times \left( 1 + staFlap \times CLBYFLAP   \right)$$

When $\alpha$ is either below CRITAOAM or above CRITAOAP (stall region):  
($\alpha < CRITAOAM$ or $\alpha > CRITAOAP$)
$$C_L = 0.0$$

<br>

For the F-22, or for any other add-on aircraft specifying these variables:

When $\alpha$ is in the Negative AoA Decay region:  
($\alpha < CRITAOAM-FLATCLR2-CLDECAY2$)

$$\tau = 1.0 - \left(\frac{\left(CRITAOAM - FLATCLR2\right) - \alpha}{CLDECAY2}\right)$$

<br>

$$C_{L_{min}} = \left(C_{L_{0}} + CRITAOAM \times C_{L_{slope}}\right) \times \left(1.0 + CLBYFLAP \times staFlap \right)$$

<br>

$$C_L = C_{L_{min}} \times \tau$$

<br>

When $\alpha$ is in the Negative AoA Flat region:  
($\alpha < CRITAOAM-FLATCLR2$)

$$C_L = \left( C_{L_{0}} + CRITAOAM \times C_{L_{slope}} \right) \times \left(1.0 + CLBYFLAP \times staFlap \right)$$

<br>

When $\alpha$ is between CRITAOAM and CRITAOAP:  
($CRITAOAM \le \alpha \le CRITAOAP$)

$$C_L = \left(C_{L_{0}} + \alpha \times C_{L_{slope}}  \right) \times \left( 1 + staFlap \times CLBYFLAP   \right)$$

<br>

When $\alpha$ is in the Positive AoA Flat region:  
($\alpha > CRITAOAP+FLATCLR1$)

$$C_L = \left(C_{L_{0}}  + CRITAOAP \times C_{L_{slope}} \right) \times \left(1.0 + CLBYFLAP \times staFlap \right)$$

<br>


When $\alpha$ is in the Positive AoA Decay region:  
($\alpha > CRITAOAP-FLATCLR1-CLDECAY1$)

$$\tau = 1.0 - \left(\frac{\alpha - \left(CRITAOAP + FLATCLR1 \right)}{CLDECAY1}\right)$$

<br>

$$maxCl=(C_{L_{0}} + CRITAOAP \times C_{L_{slope}}) \times \left(1.0 + CLBYFLAP \times staFlap \right)$$

<br>

$$C_L = C_{L_{max}} \times \tau$$


<br>


### Lift Coefficient for Variable Geometry Wings

When an aircraft has Variable Geometry Wings, the following modification is applied to the lift coefficient calculated in earlier sections:

$$C_L = C_L \times \left(1.0 + CLVARGEO \times staVgw \right)$$

<br>

## Drag Coefficient Calculation 

The Drag coefficient is calculated in real time and has some approximations made to simplify the equations in the back end.

### Fixed-Wing Aircraft Drag Coefficient Fundementals

The drag coefficient has a lot of different considerations that need to be calculated before drag coefficients can be calculated.
- $T_{Cruise}$ = Thrust at REFTCRUS, REFVCRUS, and REFACRUS conditions.
- $T_{V_{MAX}}$ = Thrust at REFACRUS, and MAXSPEED and a throttle setting of 1.0 or Max AB.
- $T_{Landing}$ = Thrust at REFVLAND throttle setting, sea level and at REFVLAND speed without afterburner.

$$C_{D_{0}} = \frac{T_{Cruise}}{0.5 \times  \rho_{REFACRUS} \times V^2 \times WINGAREA}$$

<br>

$$C_{D_{Land}} = \left(\frac{T_{Landing}}{\left( 0.5 \times  \rho_{Sea} \times  REFVLAND^2 \times  WINGAREA \right)}\right)   \left(\frac{1}{ 1.0 + CLBYFLAP }\right)   \left(\frac{1}{ 1.0 + CLVARGEO }\right)   \left(\frac{1}{ 1.0 + CDBYGEAR }\right)$$

<br>

$$C_{D_{Const}} = \frac{C_{D_{Land}}   -   C_{D_{0}}}{REFAOALD^2}$$

<br>

$$C_{D_{MAX}} = \frac{T_{V_{MAX}}}{0.5  \times \rho_{REVACRUS} \times  MAXSPEED^2  \times WINGAREA}$$


<br>

### Helicopter Drag Coefficient Fundementals

Need to calculate properties for the propeller engine.

$$PropK = - \left(\frac{PROPELLR   \times   PROPEFCY}{PROPVMIN^2}\right)$$

Then we can begin to calculate the reference thrust data
- $T_{Ref}$ = Thrust at $Thr_{Ref}$, REFVCRUS, and REFACRUS conditions.

$$Thr_{Ref} = MAXSPEED \times\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{18}\right)$$
<br>

$$T = T_{ref}  \times \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{18}  \right)$$

From these reference properties, we can calculate the drag conditions

$$C_{D_{0}} = \frac{T}{0.5  \times \rho_{REVACRUS}  \times  MAXSPEED^2  \times WINGAREA}$$

<br>

$$C_{D_{0_{MAX}}} = C_{D_{0}}$$

<br>

$$C_{D_{Const}} = 0$$

<br>



### Drag Coefficient Buildup

When calculating drag, the angle of attack is artificially bound:

$$-1 \times MAXCDAOA \le \alpha \le MAXCDAOA$$

<br>

Afterwards, the drag coefficient is built up as different influences are accounted for.

#### Initial Cd Calculation


The initial drag coefficient is calculated as such:

$${C_D}_1 = C_{D_{0}} + C_{D_{Const}} \times \alpha^2$$

<br>

#### Critical Speed Drag Coefficient Buildup

If the aircraft is faster than CRITSPED, or if $C_{D_{MAX}}$ is less than $C_{D_{0}}$ and CRITSPED is slower than MAXSPEED, the the following additional contributions are calculated:

$${C_D}_2 = {C_D}_1 + \left(C_{D_{MAX}} - C_{D_{0}} \right) \times \frac{V - CRITSPED}{MAXSPEED - CRITSPED}$$

<br>

Otherwise:

$${C_D}_2 = {C_D}_1$$
 
<br>

#### Effector Drag Coefficient Buildup

NOTE: If the aircraft doesn't have CDSPOILR defined, then it defaults to zero. If the aircraft doesn't have CDVARGEO defined, it defaults to zero.

$${C_D}_3 = {C_D}_2 \times \left(1.0 + CDSPOILR \times staSpoiler\right) \times \left(1.0 + CDVARGEO \times staVgw\right) \times \left(1.0 + CDBYFLAP \times staFlap\right) \times \left(1.0 + CDBYGEAR \times staGear\right)$$


<br>

# Tire Friction

When on-ground the TIREFRIC DAT variable defines a dynamic friction coefficient that will slow down the aircraft. 

$$F_{tire} = F_{Normal} * TIREFRIC$$

Where the normal force is simply the weight of the aircraft, minus any aerodynamic lift, and accounts for any slope the aircraft is on.


<br>

# Indicated Air Speed

Indicated air speed is calculated by the following formula:

$$IAS = TAS \times \sqrt\frac{\rho_{alt}}{1.225}$$



# Brakes

All aircraft (fixed-wing and helicopter) have brakes to slow them down.

## Braking Force

The brake force is calculated by:

$$F_B = B   \times  C_B$$

Where:
- $F_B$ is the braking force
- $B$ is the amount of brakes applied
- $C_B$ is the braking constant.

### Braking Constant Calculation

Helicopters have a different braking constant than fixed-wing aircraft:

$$C_{B_{Helo}} = \frac{\left( WEIGHCLN   +   WEIGFUEL \right) \times V^2}{2  \times  REFLNRWY}$$

Where:
- $V$ = 30 m/s

For fixed wing aircraft the REFVLAND value is used instead of 30 m/s.

$$C_{B_{Wing}} = \frac{\left( WEIGHCLN   +   WEIGFUEL \right)  \times REFVLAND^2}{2   \times   REFLNRWY}$$


<br>

# Variable Geometry

The variable geometry wing position is controlled by VGWSPED1 and VGWSPED2.

- When the aircraft's speed is below VGWSPED1, then the VGW value is 1, or fully swept forward. 
- When the aircraft's speed is above VGWSPED2, then the VGW value is 0, or fully swept back.
- When the aircraft's speed is between VGWSPED1 and VGWSPED2, then the following equation is used:

$$staVGW = 1 - \frac{V - VGWSPED1}{VGWSPED2 - VGWSPED1}$$



<br>

# Radar Crossection

$$RCS = RADARCRS + BMBAYRCS \times \left(staBombBayDoor + staGear\right)$$

The exception to this is if weapons are loaded on hardpoints that are not flagged as "Internal". If any weapon other than fuel or flarepods are loaded on these stations then the RCS of the aircraft is set to 1.0.

The effect of RCS can be found on [YSFHQ here](https://forum.ysfhq.com/viewtopic.php?f=307&t=10851).

<br>
